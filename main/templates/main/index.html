            Our music center offers six rehearsal rooms – tailor-made for a community of creative and professional musicians, 
            bands, and solo practitioners. Everyone is welcome! 
            <br><br>You play guitar but aren’t in a band? 
            No problem. You love classical music but can’t host a grand piano at home? You’re in the right place. 
            You want to practice saxophone but don’t want to annoy anyone at home? Come on in and meet others just like you!
            <br><br>
            Sooner or later, you’ll meet fellow artists here. Just register and book your room!
